Solving ill-posed inverse problems using iterative deep neural networks
=======================================================================

This repository will contain the code for the article "Solving ill-posed inverse problems using
iterative deep neural networks" [published on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04058).

Contents
--------
The code contains the following

* Training using ellipse phantoms
* Evaluation on ellipse phantoms
* Training using anthropomorphic data. (Data not included for legal/privacy reasons)
* Evaluation on example head slice
* Reference reconstructions of the above using [ODL](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl).

Dependencies
------------
The code is currently based on an experimental version of [ODL](https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/pull/972), so that specific branch needs to be used for the code to work.
